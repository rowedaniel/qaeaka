Derek's Space Station Game Idea:
- base building space station
- in-depth tech tree
  - reverse-engineer stuff
- different starting traits
  - complete randomization (with weights towards boring, bad stuff) or manual customization (only boring, bad stuff)
  - brain, cardiovascular, metabolism, arms/legs, skeleton
  - brains (skills)
      - biological - low talent, high aptitude, stress from ugly
      - digital  - high talent, low aptitude, stress from pretty
      - analog (expert mode) - high talent, high aptitude, stress from everything, manually increase skills (with soldering iron)
  - cardiovascular (vitality & stamina)
      - biological - high healing, low vitality and medium stamina
      - mechanical - very low healing (manual maintenence), medium vitality and high stamina
      - synthetic - high healing, very low vitality, and high stamina
  - metabolism (food, poison)
      - mostly random
      - biological - tends towards organic material, high poison risk, high poison recovery, hunger increases passively
      - mechanical - tends towards inorganic material, low poison risk, low poison recovery, hunger mostly increase with actions
      - ferrous - exclusively inorganic material, very low poison risk, no poison recovery, hunger increase with actions
      - locust - can eat anything, very high poison risk, very high poison recovery, hunger passively increases very rapidly
  - arms/legs (movement, strength)
      - mechanical (more energy, more performance) or biological (less energy, less performance)
      - frog (very high mobility, very low strength, high energy consumption with actions)
      - kangaroo (high mobility, medium strength, medium energy consumption)
      - gorilla (low mobility, very high strength, high energy consumptions)
      - human (medium mobility, medium strength, low energy consumption)
      - milipede (medium mobility, low strength, low energy consumption)
      - slug (very low mobility, low strength, medium energy consumption)
  - skeleton (charisma, cosmetics)
      - calcium - high charisma, 
      - robotic endoskeleton - low charisma,
      - slimy insectoid exoskeleton - very low charisma,
      - no skeleton - very high charisma
  - starting skills (grows proportional to aptitude, with exponential decay)
  - aptitudes (very hard to change - gacha [normal variation, randomly selected from it. Also takes a lot of research/resources])
  - talent (hard to change - gacha)
  - skill barriers on items/research, talent controls success
- crafting
  - element-based?
- magic
- make a lot of it procedurally generated
  - procedural weapons
  - procedural materials
- include:
  - fishing minigame
  - knife sharpening system
- 2.5D

Challenges:
- asteroids
- hostile alien life
  - ai-controlled dopplegangers
- alien remnants
- personal health
  - thirst, hunger, scurvy, stress
- station health
  - temp, O2, nuclear
- random events
